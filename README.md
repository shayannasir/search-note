# Search Note

**Search Note** is a Note Taking application optimised for seaching and quick keyboard inputs.

All the actions in *search-note* are performed via keyboard shortcuts.

## Structure

Search Note has 2 stages/layouts, specifically:-

1. **Table:**: Tables are the main entry points to a document. Analogous to a collection inside a Document based Database, a single Table may hold numerous *Entries*
2. **Entry**: Entries exist within a particular table and have 3 attributes in them - key, value and description.

## Functionality

Search helps in quick retrieval of notes by fetching quickly the searched keyword. In both Tables and Entries, the types keyword is in-real-time fetched from the Database.

## Portability

As of it's first release, Search Note can be downloaded as a jar or a .deb package . With time, more OS-specific executables of the application will be released.

### Development

Search Note in under active development.
